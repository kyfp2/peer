## DesiVPS Reviews

DesiVPS has received mixed reviews from users, with an average rating of 3.5 out of 5 stars on Trustpilot based on 8 reviews. Positive feedback highlights the company's competitive pricing, reliable infrastructure with 99.9% uptime, excellent hardware quality using AMD Ryzen 9 processors and NVMe storage, lightning-fast loading speeds, and affordable VPS solutions suitable for small businesses. Several long-term customers praised the dedicated server performance over 4+ years and commended the 24/7 customer support availability.

However, some users reported concerns about slow support response times and reliability issues. One customer experienced a security incident in November 2022 where a node was compromised, resulting in data loss without adequate communication or compensation from the company. The bandwidth controls were also mentioned as somewhat restrictive by some users.

Despite these criticisms, many reviewers recommend DesiVPS for small-scale projects, game servers, hobby websites, and startups looking for budget-friendly hosting solutions with decent network performance and hardware specifications. The company's use of proprietary hardware, instant setup, free site migration, and free DDoS protection up to 20Gbps are frequently cited as valuable features.
